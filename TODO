PROJECT
- clear unneccessary files
- test suite?
- encode/decode uses int to store coded data. Is this platform independent?
- find out if inheretence from bufferedport is the best way to do things (might not need to with change in bottle)

EBOTTLE
- make event statistics dumper an app that can run in yarpmanager
- make the resource finder set the values for file saving etc.
- add timestamps to eEvents
- find best method to return events from the eBottle (use the isSpecificEventType() and write .asSpecificEventType() commands?)
