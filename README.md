iCub eMorph Project

How to Install:


TODO:
- [ ] write a readme with installation instructions
- [ ] test cases
- [ ] encode/decode uses int to store coded data. Is this platform independent?
- [ ] do we still need header codes in the coded data? (compatibility with hardware?)
- [ ] ensure coding style + documentation + headers are compliant with iCub standards
- [ ] doxygen and comments
- [ ] update worthwhile old modules to vBottle and maintain for demos etc.
- [ ] update vCodec for more event types
- [ ] update vFrame for more event types
