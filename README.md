iCub eMorph Project

How to Install:

eventDriven is installed as an iCub-contrib module, instructions here:
http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Linux:Installation_from_sources

TODO:
- [ ] write a readme with installation instructions
- [ ] test cases
- [ ] encode/decode uses int to store coded data. Is this platform independent?
- [ ] ensure coding style+documentation+headers are compliant with iCub standards
- [ ] doxygen and comments
- [ ] update worthwhile old modules to vBottle and maintain for demos etc.
- [X] update vCodec for more event types
- [X] update vFrame for more event types
- [ ] header codes in data should be checked in vCodec (decode)
- [X] vFrame should be flexible (cmd line) when new drawing methods are created
