The iCub event-driven Project

Libraries that handle neuromorphic sensors, such as the dynamic vision sensor, installed on the iCub can be found here, along with algorithms to process the event-based data. Examples include, optical flow, corner detection and ball detection. Demo applications for controlling the robot based on event input are also found here.

How to Install:

eventDriven is installed as an iCub-contrib module and requires, at the minimum yarp to be install. Instructions are here:
